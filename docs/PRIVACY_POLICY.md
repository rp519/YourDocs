# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** February 17, 2026
**Last Updated:** February 17, 2026

YourDocs Team ("we", "us", or "our") operates the YourDocs mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the App.

## 1. Local-Only Document Storage

All documents, folders, and associated data you create or import in the App are stored locally on your device. Your documents never leave your device unless you explicitly choose to share or export them.

## 2. No Data Collection or Transmission

The App does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. We do not operate any servers or cloud services that receive your data. Your documents and organizational data remain entirely on your device.

## 3. Biometric and PIN Data

The App offers biometric authentication (fingerprint/face) and PIN-based locking for folders. Biometric authentication is handled entirely by the Android operating system through the AndroidX Biometric library. We never access, store, or transmit your biometric data. PIN values are hashed locally on your device and are never stored in plain text or transmitted anywhere.

## 4. Backup and Restore

The App allows you to create backup files containing your folders and documents. These backup files are created and stored locally on your device. Sharing or transferring backup files is initiated solely by you through your device's share functionality. We have no access to your backup files.

## 5. Payment Information

Premium features are purchased through Google Play Billing. All payment processing is handled entirely by Google Play. The App does not collect, store, or have access to any payment information, including credit card numbers, billing addresses, or other financial data. Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for information on how Google handles payment data.

## 6. No Analytics or Tracking

The App does not use any analytics services, advertising SDKs, crash reporting tools, or tracking technologies. We do not collect usage data, device identifiers, or any form of telemetry.

## 7. Third-Party Services

The only third-party service integrated into the App is Google Play Billing for processing premium purchases. The App also uses Google ML Kit's on-device document scanner, which processes images locally on your device without sending data to external servers.

## 8. Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since the App does not collect any data, no special provisions for children's data are necessary.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be communicated through App updates on Google Play. Your continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
