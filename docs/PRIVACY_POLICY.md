# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** February 17, 2026
**Last Updated:** February 17, 2026

*Updated to reflect new features including document tags, notes, favorites, expiry reminders, home screen widget, document sharing, and search functionality.*

YourDocs Team ("we", "us", or "our") operates the YourDocs mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the App.

## 1. Local-Only Document Storage

All documents, folders, and associated data you create or import in the App are stored locally on your device. Your documents never leave your device unless you explicitly choose to share or export them.

## 2. No Data Collection or Transmission

The App does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. We do not operate any servers or cloud services that receive your data. Your documents and organizational data remain entirely on your device.

## 3. Biometric and PIN Data

The App offers biometric authentication (fingerprint/face) and PIN-based locking for folders. Biometric authentication is handled entirely by the Android operating system through the AndroidX Biometric library. We never access, store, or transmit your biometric data. PIN values are hashed locally on your device and are never stored in plain text or transmitted anywhere.

## 4. Backup and Restore

The App allows you to create backup files containing your folders, documents, tags, notes, expiry dates, and other metadata. These backup files are created and stored locally on your device. Sharing or transferring backup files is initiated solely by you through your device's share functionality. We have no access to your backup files.

## 5. Payment Information

Premium features are purchased through Google Play Billing. All payment processing is handled entirely by Google Play. The App does not collect, store, or have access to any payment information, including credit card numbers, billing addresses, or other financial data. Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for information on how Google handles payment data.

## 6. Notifications

The App may send local notifications to remind you about upcoming document expiry dates. These notifications are generated and scheduled entirely on your device. No notification data is sent to external servers. You can disable notifications at any time through your device's system settings.

## 7. Home Screen Widget

The App offers an optional home screen widget that displays your pinned folders or favorite documents for quick access. The widget reads data only from the App's local database on your device. No data is transmitted externally through the widget.

## 8. Document Sharing

The App allows you to share documents through your device's built-in share functionality. When you share a document, it is sent directly from your device to the app or contact you choose. YourDocs does not intercept, copy, or store any shared data beyond what is already stored locally in the App.

## 9. Device Permissions

The App may request the following device permissions, which are used solely for their stated purpose:

- **Camera:** Used only for scanning physical documents within the App.
- **Storage/Files:** Used only for importing documents from your device and creating local backup files.
- **Notifications:** Used only for sending local reminders about document expiry dates.

These permissions are never used to access data beyond what is necessary for the App's core functionality.

## 10. No Analytics or Tracking

The App does not use any analytics services, advertising SDKs, crash reporting tools, or tracking technologies. We do not collect usage data, device identifiers, or any form of telemetry.

## 11. Data Deletion

When you delete a document or folder within the App, it is permanently removed from your device along with any associated tags, notes, expiry dates, and other metadata. When you uninstall the App, all locally stored data including documents, folders, favorites, recently viewed history, and settings is removed from your device. Since we do not store any of your data on external servers, we do not retain any copies of your documents or data after deletion or uninstallation.

## 12. Third-Party Services

The only third-party service integrated into the App is Google Play Billing for processing premium purchases. The App also uses Google ML Kit's on-device document scanner, which processes images locally on your device without sending data to external servers.

## 13. Your Rights (CCPA, GDPR, and Other Privacy Laws)

Since the App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers, there is no personal data for us to provide, delete, or stop processing. If you have any questions about your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or any other applicable privacy law, please contact us and we will be happy to assist.

## 14. Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since the App does not collect any data, no special provisions for children's data are necessary.

## 15. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be communicated through App updates on Google Play. Your continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
