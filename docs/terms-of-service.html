        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="meta">Effective Date: February 17, 2026 &middot; Last Updated: February 17, 2026</p>
        <p class="intro">Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the YourDocs mobile application (the "App") operated by YourDocs Team ("we", "us", or "our").</p>
        <p>By using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>YourDocs is a mobile application for personal document organization. The App allows you to create folders, import and scan documents, organize files with tags and notes, set expiry reminders, search across folders, and manage your documents locally on your device.</p>

        <h2>2. Premium Purchase</h2>

        <h3>2.1 One-Time Purchase</h3>
        <p>The App offers a one-time premium upgrade ("YourDocs Pro") that unlocks additional features. This is a single, non-recurring digital purchase processed through Google Play.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>All sales are final after the Google Play refund window has expired. Refund requests within the eligible window should be directed to Google Play. YourDocs Team does not process refunds directly.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Premium Features</h3>
        <p>Premium features currently include unlimited folders and documents, biometric and PIN folder locking, backup and restore functionality, custom folder colors, document tags, expiry reminders with notifications, home screen widget, and multi-select document operations. Premium features may be updated, expanded, or modified over time. We reserve the right to add new premium features in future updates at no additional cost to existing Pro users.</p>

        <h2>3. Free Tier Limitations</h2>
        <p>Free users may create up to 5 folders and store up to 50 documents. These limits may be adjusted in future updates. Existing data that exceeds any updated limits will not be deleted; only the creation of new items beyond the limit will be restricted.</p>

        <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Backups</h3>
        <p>You are solely responsible for maintaining backups of your documents and data. We strongly recommend creating regular backups of your important documents using the App's backup feature or other means.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Document Content</h3>
        <p>You are solely responsible for the content of documents you store in the App. The App is intended for personal document organization only. You agree not to use the App for any unlawful purpose.</p>

        <h3>4.3 Device Security</h3>
        <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device, including any PINs or biometric access configured within the App.</p>

        <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p class="legal">The App is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>
        <p>YourDocs Team does not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components. We do not warrant that any data stored in the App will be preserved indefinitely or protected from loss.</p>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p class="legal">To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, YourDocs Team shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, documents, profits, or revenue, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data or document corruption, regardless of the cause of action or the theory of liability.</p>
        <p>This includes, but is not limited to, any data loss resulting from device failure, App updates, uninstallation, or any other circumstance. You acknowledge that maintaining backups of your important documents is your responsibility.</p>

        <h2>7. Intended Use</h2>
        <p>The App is intended for personal document organization only. It is not designed or intended for use as a primary document storage solution, a secure vault for highly sensitive documents, or a replacement for professional document management systems.</p>

        <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The App, including its design, code, and content, is the property of YourDocs Team and is protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App for personal purposes.</p>

        <h2>9. Modifications to the Service</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the App or any part thereof at any time, with or without notice. We shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the App.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be communicated through App updates on Google Play. Your continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

        <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable laws, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
