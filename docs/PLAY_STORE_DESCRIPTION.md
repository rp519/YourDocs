YourDocs — Your Documents, Organized & Secure

Tired of scrolling through cluttered galleries and file managers to find important documents? YourDocs is a clean, simple document organizer that keeps all your important files — IDs, receipts, certificates, bills, and more — neatly sorted in folders, right on your phone.

Organize Everything in Folders
Create custom folders for any category — "Medical Records", "Tax Documents", "Warranties" — whatever you need. Add names, descriptions, and emoji icons to make each folder instantly recognizable. Pin your most-used folders to the top for quick access.

Import Documents Your Way
Add documents by importing files from your device, picking images from your gallery, or scanning physical documents directly with your camera. YourDocs supports PDFs, images, and scanned documents so everything lives in one place.

Built-in Document Viewer
View your documents without leaving the app. Open PDFs, zoom into images, and browse through your files with a smooth, full-screen viewer.

Lock Sensitive Folders
Keep private documents safe with folder locking. Choose your preferred security method — PIN, biometric (fingerprint/face), or both. Locked folders require authentication before anyone can open, rename, or delete them.

Backup & Restore
Never lose your organized documents. Back up your entire library and restore it anytime — perfect for switching devices or keeping a safety net.

Dark Mode & Themes
Choose between light mode, dark mode, or let the app follow your system theme for a comfortable viewing experience day and night.
